<div class="ragnarok-text">
  But if you write a version of Ragnarok in the twenty-first century, it is
  haunted by the imagining of a different end of things. We are a species of
  animal which is bringing about the end of the world we were born into. Not out
  of evil or malice, or not mainly, but because of a lopsided mixture of
  extraordinary cleverness, extraordinary greed, extraordinary proliferation of
  our own kind, and a biologically built-in short-sightedness.
